# Portfolio-Site
Navigation: The site has a navigation menu with links to different sections within the page - Home, Skills, Projects, and Contact.

Sections:

Preloader: Shows a cool windows terminal animation
Home: Displays a welcome message
Skills: Divided into Front-End, Back-End, and Other skills sections, showcasing the technologies and skills I'm proficient in.
Projects: Displays a collection of projects, each represented by an image. Clicking on an image opens a modal showing details about the project, including its name, links to GitHub and live demos, and a brief description.
Contact: Provides a form for visitors to reach out to me.
JavaScript Functionality: Several JavaScript files are included, presumably for functionality like typing animation on the home section, filtering of projects using Isotope library, and other interactivity.
External Resources: Utilizes external resources such as Font Awesome icons, custom CSS files, and Isotope JavaScript library.
Planning to add a Blog Section as well.
